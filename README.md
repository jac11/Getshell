To gain control over a compromised system, an attacker usually aims to gain interactive shell access for arbitrary command execution. With such access, they can try to elevate their privileges to obtain full control of the operating system. However, most systems are behind firewalls and direct remote shell connections are impossible. One of the methods used to circumvent this limitation is a reverse shell.
